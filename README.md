Balancing Experiment Design

In approaching this problem you first need to randomize participants and randomize the task sequence. Here, I used the "secrets" package which claims to be superior to the random package in python (not producing psuedo random values, https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html). While not done here, to be sure of our randomization during group assignment, we could do compund operations on our random number obtained from secrets.randbelow before taking its remainder. For example, we can sum, divide and round 3 random numbers before taking its remainder in an attempt to clear away any biases. Additionally, a limitation I didn't guarantee balanced task sequences BETWEEN groups. I produced the task sequence assignments based on choosing a random element in the list of task permutations, but by chance we could have a bias in task order in one group, leading to training and ordering effects. Here, with small enough permutations, it may be more efficient to do this in a spreadsheet, making sure all groups experience each pair occurring as equally as possible (e.g. having each group have x task sequences with XL as the start, x with YL as the start, etc).
