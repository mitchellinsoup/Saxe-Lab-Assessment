# Saxe-Lab-Assessment (Chan_Mitchell; SP25)
1. Balancing Experiment Design
   - 1.saxe_balancegroups.py uses a sample of n = 100 as an example
   - 1.example_output.csv shows one potential result from the script
  
2. Understanding lab standard scripts
   - both 2.saxe_heudi_notes.py and 2.submit_heudiconv_array_notes.sh are the same as the scripts in the sax lab github, just with notes per line/block of code
